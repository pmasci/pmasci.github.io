# Biography

Paolo Masci is a Senior Research Scientist at the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) and NASA Langley Research Center (NASA LsRC). 

His expertise is on modeling and verification of human-machine interfaces for safety-critical systems.
Prior to joining NIA/NASA LaRC, he developed his career in various universities and research institutions, including the University of Pisa (Italy), Queen Mary University of London (UK), and University of Minho (Portugal). 

For several years, he has been working in close collaboration with medical device manufacturers, hospitals, and medical device regulatory authorities, to carry out applied research on medical devices, e.g., see his publications on [infusion pump software research](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/infusion-pumps/infusion-pump-software-safety-research-fda) carried out in collaboration with researchers at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health.

He received his PhD in Information Engineering from the University of Pisa, Italy, in 2008.
